##Question 1

1. The benefit of an AVL tree over a regular binary search tree is the fact that an AVL tree is gaurenteed height of log n which means that
    all operations such as insertion, deletion and retrieval are all guarenteed time O (log n) worst case complexity where a binary search tree 
    is O(n) worst case complexity.
2. While AVL trees and Red-Black Trees have the same worst case complexities, the reason Red-Black trees are 'better' than an AVL tree is that during insertion and deletion, a Red-Black tree has a guarenteed constant amount of refactoring 
    where as in an AVL tree the restructurings could propogate up the entire tree making the effectivity of the tree useless. For this reason red-black trees are a better implementation.
